# 2. Design Website 
In this project we used several programming languages which are (HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT , PHP ) .

# 3. Dynamic Components
Home site , Dishes Review site and search box.

# 4. Business Logic
• The structure of the database consists of a table of contents and contains columns and rows.

• Through the HTML file, the user enters certain texts “comments”, which are the name, and message to be sent to the database.

• Through the PHP file, we create a local host to connect the database with the HTML file and store the information entered on the server.
